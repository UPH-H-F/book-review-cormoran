      <h2 class="book-title">Troubled Blood (Cormoran Strike Series #5)</h2>
      <p class="author">By Robert Galbraith</p>
      <p class="summary">
        <h3><span class="styled">Summary</span></h3>
        <p style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;">In the epic fifth installment in this “compulsively readable” series, Galbraith’s “irresistible hero and heroine” take on the decades-old cold case of a missing doctor, one which may be their grisliest yet. Private Detective Cormoran Strike is visiting his family in Cornwall when he is approached by a woman asking for help finding her mother, Margot Bamborough—who went missing in mysterious circumstances in 1974. Strike has never tackled a cold case before, let alone one forty years old. But despite the slim chance of success, he is intrigued and takes it on; adding to the long list of cases that he and his partner in the agency, Robin Ellacott, are currently working on. And Robin herself is also juggling a messy divorce and unwanted male attention, as well as battling her own feelings about Strike. As Strike and Robin investigate Margot’s disappearance, they come up against a fiendishly complex case with leads that include tarot cards, a psychopathic serial killer, and witnesses who cannot all be trusted. And they learn that even cases decades old can prove to be deadly.</p>

      </h3>
      <p style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;">Robert Galbraith is a pseudonym for J.K. Rowling, bestselling author of the Harry Potter series and The Casual Vacancy. The four previous Strike novels, The Cuckoo's Calling, The Silkworm, Career of Evil and Lethal White, topped the national and international bestseller lists and the series has been adapted for television, produced by Brontë Film and Television.</p>

    <h2 style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; font-weight: bold;"><i>Five Books</i> Review</h2>
        <p><i>Troubled Blood</i> arrived on my doorstep on September 15th, the day of publication, all 927 pages of it. I ordered it to review it asap, but with all the other things going on in my life, it’s taken me a week to read it. I slightly regret the rush, because a new Robert Galbraith book is one of the reading highlights of the year for me and I love listening to the audiobooks in particular. Robert Glenister, the British actor who has been the narrator for all the books, just makes the characters come completely alive. You live in their world, you go through the day with them—and I can’t wait to go running or do the laundry so I can go back to listening to them. I did listen to chunks of Troubled Blood as an audiobook, but at 30+ hours, I felt I should rush and read the print book instead.</p>
    
        <p>I think this was a mistake. I think in the same way a movie can ruin a book, listening to an audiobook can fill the characters in your head to such an extent that it’s hard to read them on your own afterwards. For example, based on Robert Glenister’s narration of him, the main character in the series—Afghan war veteran Cormoran Strike—sounds exactly like Hagrid from the Harry Potter movies, and so appears in my mind as British actor Robbie Coltrane. But (obviously, as he came up with it) Glenister is much better at doing this voice than I am, and so my own reading of Strike is not as convincing as the picture I already have of him from listening to my audiobook. Glenister is also able to do an amazing array of regional British accents—the other main character, Robin Ellacott, is from Yorkshire—in a way that I can’t in my own head.</p>
    
        <p>Overall, I didn’t like <i>Troubled Blood</i> as much as the previous book, <i>Lethal White</i> (which admittedly set a very high bar; I loved it). It’s partly because <i>Troubled Blood</i> is about a cold case, which makes it seem a bit more distant, in terms of building tension and the need to get a resolution before another crime is committed. There’s also a lot in <i>Troubled Blood</i> about astrology, which is something I don’t have much time for. It’s not something I want to learn more about, either, so those bits—which may have been cleverly done, I don’t know—somewhat passed me by.</p>
    
        <p>It’s still one of the best mysteries I’ve read all year. The book is cleverly plotted, the victim in the cold case that Strike and Robin are investigating an impressive woman you want to know. I enjoyed being in Cornwall, in Clerkenwell, and at Hampton Court. I found the denouement, when I found out what had happened all those decades before, satisfying.</p>
    
        <p>What <i>Troubled Blood</i> isn’t is a pacy thriller. It’s more of a slow-burn mystery. The enjoyment comes from the characters, how they interact, the insights into human nature. Galbraith/Rowling is trying to depict what it’s like running a detective agency and the day-to-dayness of life, the coffees in the morning, the pints of beer at night, the difficulties in forming a relationship when you have a job that is all-consuming.</p>
    
        <p>Because it’s so much about the human interactions, it’s a series where it probably is best to start with the first one, so you can get to know the characters. We’ve listed the Cormoran Strike books in order here, with our thoughts about the series as a whole. If, like I do, you love the first ones, you’ll want to read <i>Troubled Blood</i> too. If you don’t, there’s plenty of other books out there.</p>

      <div class="comment-content"><p>I've been reading this series in order, and they get better with each one. They are extremely long, but definitely worth the energy, in my opinion.<br>
        The relationship between Strike and Robin, as with all the other books, play a big part in it. Which I like.<br>
        There are a lot of characters in this book to keep track of. But because it is a cold case, they are investigating there were a lot of people to interview.<br>
        I loved the way it came together in the conclusion. I didn't guess what was going to happen, and the way it ended kept me thinking about it for a while afterwards.<br>
        Looking forward to the next in the series already</p></div>

      <div class="comment-content">The mystery in this book is good but what makes me fly through this series is all the personal backstory. In this story especially Cormoran and Robin's lives and what they are going through are very touching and relatable and worth the read.</div>

      <div class="comment-content"><p>Wow is it just me or are these books getting longer and longer just for the sake of being huge? The Comoran Strike series, to me, is a series that I am well aware that it will take about 50% of the book to establish the victim(s), backstories, witnesses, etc. However, I felt that this book in particular had a lot of filler, just so the books could continue to duplicate in length. I honestly feel that this story (all 944 pages of it) could have easily been 600 pages and still included all of the needed back stories while still hooking the reader and not losing them between the endless pages. I committed to finishing this series, so regardless of how many years it takes, I plan on reading the entire series, however, not all readers are as stubborn. I fear that the ever growing length is sure to lose a handful of readers, no matter how good the story.<br>
